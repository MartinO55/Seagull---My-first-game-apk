# Seagull---My-first-game-apk

So this is the first game I made and completed with Unity (and it shows). 
I did all of the programming, 3D modelling, rigging and animating myself; 
in fact the only thing I didn't do was the sound ocmposition! Unfortunately, this was before I
discovered Git and github, so there is no history or source code available, 
but I have uploaded the completed .apk file to github for you to download. 

It should run on any android device.
